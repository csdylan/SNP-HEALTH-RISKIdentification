# SNP-HEALTH-RISKIdentification
Users can upload their DNA in a text file saved from services such as Ancestry and 23andme. This project identifies the SNPs in the DNA, stores it, and compares it to SNPs associated with cancer saved in an SNP database. Any SNPs in the user's DNA then gets returned along with the cancer type, and the altered risk associated with it.
